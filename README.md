============

The goal of this lab is to learn how consistent hashing works by implementing a proof of concept (POC) client-side sharding, aka consistent hash ring.

## Steps
The baseline code has two modules--client and server--and you can be running three server instances (A, B, and C) and one client that talks to the servers. You won’t be making any changes to the server module, but all consistent hashing implementation should be on the client side only.
Run the baseline code first to understand how GET and PUT to the distributed cache work before sharding the data. All the data should be distributed across:
A: http://localhost:3000
B: http://localhost:3001
C: http://localhost:3002

1. Implement node (cache server) lookup using consistent hashing in the client module. 
2. Call the consistent hash interface from step 1 to get bucket number.
3. From the client, PUT this below sequence of key-value pairs into the three cache servers and check each server at http://localhost:300{0|1|2}/cache/ to make sure data is sharded across three servers.
● {Key => Value} 
● 1 => a
● 2 => b
● 3 => c
● 4 => d 
● 5 => e
● 6 => f 
● 7 => g 
● 8 => h 
● 9 => i 
● 10 => j
4. Finally, retrieve all keys, 1 to 10, via GET(x) and print out their values to the console.
